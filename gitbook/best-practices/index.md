*Akkamo platform* opens the possibility to write custom modules for various different technologies,
frameworks and libraries. Anyone can contribute with own module, which can be handy for other
people. Although every developer has his/her own coding style, keeping the following recommendations
when writing *Akkamo modules* may simplify adoption your module by another developer, and you might
find adopting someone's module easier too.

This chapter describes best practices, gotchas and possible headscratchers when working with
different parts of the *Akkamo platform*.

- Chapter [Module configuration](module-config.md) describes best practices for designing

- Chapter [Module dependencies](module-dependencies.md) describes best practices when working
